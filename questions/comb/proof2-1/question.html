  <p>A DNA strand can be viewed as a string over the alphabet $\{A,C,G,T\}$ of DNA bases. While DNA is a double-stranded structure, it is often enough to consider one of the two strands as a string because the other strand is uniquely determined by Watson-Crick base pairs. We define the <em>Watson-Crick complement</em> $\theta(w)$ of a string $w$ inductively by:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>if $w = \varepsilon$ is empty, then $\theta(\varepsilon) = \varepsilon$,
        <li>if $w = a \in \{A,C,G,T\}$ is a DNA base, then $\theta(A) = T, \theta(C) = G, \theta(G) = C, \theta(T) = A$,
        <li>if $w = ax$ for a DNA strand $x \in \{A,C,G,T\}^*$ and a DNA base $a \in \{A,C,G,T\}$, then $\theta(w) = \theta(x)\theta(a)$.
        </ul>
    <p>In other words, the Watson-Crick function $\theta$ swaps each letter representing a base to the corresponding complementary base <em>and</em> reverses the string. For example, $$\theta(ATTACG) = CGTAAT.$$
    One kind of interesting DNA strand is a string that is equal to its own Watson-Crick complement. That is, $w = \theta(w)$. Such strings are called <em>Watson-Crick palindromes</em> or <em>$\theta$-palindromes</em>.</p>
    <p>How many DNA strings of length $n$ are Watson-Crick palindromes if $n$ is even?</p>
