    <pl-answer correct="true" tag="2" depends="" > Suppose we have a binary string (a string over $\{0,1\}$) of length $3n$ that contains $n$ $0$s and $2n$ $1$s. We will show two ways to count these strings.</pl-answer>

    <pl-answer correct="true" tag="17" depends="16" > This gives us \[\sum_{k=0}^n \binom n k \binom{2n}{n-k}\] possible binary strings of length $3n$ that contain $n$ $0$s.</pl-answer>
