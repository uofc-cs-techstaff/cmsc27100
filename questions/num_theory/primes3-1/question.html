        <pl-answer correct="true" tag="8" depends="7" > Then the prime factors of $N$ cannot be $p_1, \dots, p_n$, since dividing $N$ by any $p_i$ admits a remainder of $p_i - 1 \neq 0$.</pl-answer>
        <pl-answer correct="true" tag="9" depends="7" > Since $N$ is odd, it must have an odd prime factor, which is of the form $4k+1$ or $4k+3$.</pl-answer>

        <pl-answer correct="true" tag="11" depends="10" > But the product of two primes of the form $4k+1$ is a number of the form $4k+1$, since $(4\ell+1)(4m+1) = 4(4\ell m + \ell + m) + 1$.</pl-answer>
        <pl-answer correct="true" tag="12" depends="11" > Therefore, $N$ must have a prime factor of the form $4k+3$ not in the list $p_1, \dots, p_n$.</pl-answer>
