  <p>Suppose we are sending a message one bit at a time over a noisy channel which has a ${{params.err}}$ chance of introducing error (i.e. it sends the wrong bit). Suppose we send a stream of random bits through the channel with probability ${{params.s0}}$ of sending a <code>0</code> and probability ${{params.s1}}$ of sending a <code>1</code>. What is the probability that a <code>{{params.send}}</code> was sent, given that a <code>{{params.rec}}</code> is received?</p>
