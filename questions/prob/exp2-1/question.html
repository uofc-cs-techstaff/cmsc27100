  <p>Suppose you have a deck of $n$ cards, which are flipped over one at a time. Before each card is flipped over, you guess what the card is going to be, uniformly at random. As each card is revealed, you are able to remember it, so you know not to guess those cards that have already shown up.</p>
  <p>How many cards do you expect to guess correctly?</p>

    <p><strong>Note.</strong> The number $H(n) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac 1 i$ is called the <strong>$n$th harmonic number</strong>.</p>
