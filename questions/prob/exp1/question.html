  <p>Suppose $n$ people go inside a shop simultaneously and leave their umbrellas by the door. When they exit the shop simultaneously, they take an umbrella uniformly at random, which may or may not be the one they entered the shop with. What is the expected number of people who take the umbrella they had when they entered the shop?</p>

    <pl-answer correct="true" tag="5" depends="" > The probability that a person takes their own umbrella is $\frac 1 n$.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true" tag="6" depends="3,5" > Then $E(X_i) = 1 \cdot \frac 1 n + 0 \cdot \frac{n-1}n = \frac 1 n$.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true" tag="7" depends="4,6" > By linearity of expectation, $E(X) = E(X_1 + \cdots + X_n) = E(X_1) + \cdots + E(X_n)$.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true" tag="8" depends="7" > Therefore, $E(X) = n \cdot \frac 1 n = 1$.</pl-answer>
